# Deadline

Almost everyone faced with the concept of deadline.  
This project will help you visualize your deadline.

All you need is open the [page](https://topor-dev.github.io/deadline), enter the time limit and click "start new countdown".

### Time limits can be:
- after time - e.g. after 15 minutes, starts from now
- at time - e.g. at 18:00
*if now is more than 'at-time', at-time counts as time of next day*

### Mask ```HH:MM[:SS]```
- ```HH``` - hours (0-23)
- ```MM``` - minutes (0-59)
- ```SS``` - seconds (0-59) 

```HH:MM``` - required part, and ```:SS``` - optional part

So, possible values are:
- 0:0:10 - 10 seconds
- 0:15:25 - 15 minutes and 25 seconds
- 0:15 - 15 minutes
- 2:30 - 2.5 hours
